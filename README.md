# MEIC2CMAQ  
This is a tool to process MEIC(http://meicmodel.org/) Emission Data for CMAQ Modeling.
## Data Pre-intepolation  
Sample emission files were uploaded, and I will explain how to do this later.

## Biogenic Emissions  
Biogenic emissions were estimated with my previous work SimpleBIO, I merged the codes into this program.

## How to use
I am too lazy to write a mannual for it for the moment.
